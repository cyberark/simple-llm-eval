# Judge Models and Authentication  üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏èüîë

Simpleval supports several judges, each one with its own authentication method.
The way to authenticate with each judge is usually via environment variables or similar implicit methods.
There might also be judge-specific details found below.

You can see how each judge type is authenticated below, but in short, most judges are based on Lite LLM,
so you can always also refer to its documentation.

!!! tip
    You can view supported model ids for Lite LLM judges by running:

    ```bash
    simpleval litellm-models-explorer
    ```
