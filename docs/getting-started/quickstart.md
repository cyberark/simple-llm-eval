### Requirements

‚úÖ Python 3.11 or later üêç

### Installation

‚úÖ Install the package using `pip`, `uv` (or with your favorite package manager):

???- note "Python Native"

    **Recommended to use a virtual environment:**

    Create the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

    Activate the virtual environment:
    
    ???- note "Linux/Mac"
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate 
        ```

    ???- note "Windows"
        ```bat
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```


    **Install the package:**

    ```bash
    pip install simpleval
    ```

???- note "uv package manager"

    **Using a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    uv venv
    ```
    
    **Activate the virtual environment:**
    
    ???- note "Linux/Mac"
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate 
        ```

    ???- note "Windows"
        ```bat
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```


    **Install the package:**

    ```bash
    uv add simpleval
    ```

???- note "Using uvx"

    **Run any command with uvx, for example:**

    ```bash
    uvx simpleval init
    ```

    !!! warning "Important Note"
        Since uvx runs commands in an isolated environment, you will not have the benefits of a virtual environment when implementing your own handlers.
        
        In this case, consider creating a virtual environment and installing the package as described above.

### Usage

‚úÖ Run `simpleval init` and follow the instructions, or instead, follow the [Tutorial](./tutorial.md) section.

To see all available commands, run `simpleval`
