# Tutorial 👩‍🏫

After you go through the [Quickstart](./quickstart.md) section, you can follow this tutorial for a quick example.

**Make sure you can run `simpleval` before you continue.**

This can be in a python virtual environment (recommended) or as a cli tool.

## The Scenario 🧾
You are testing whether an LLM can answer questions about a short story called "The Clockmaker's Secret"[^1]
[^1]: "The Clockmaker's Secret" is a silly story generated by ChatGPT.


You will compare how two different prompts are doing by using `simpleval` to evaluate and compare their results.
This is done with the "LLM as a judge" technique.

---------

## Setup ⚙️

### ✅ Set LLM credentials
Make sure you have the credentials set for the LLM you want to use.
See supported providers and their required credentials in the [Judge Models and Authentication](./judge-authentication.md) section.

### ✅ Init the evaluation set

- [ ] Run the interactive init command:

```bash
simpleval init
```

- [ ] For `Enter eval folder...:` enter `story-q-and-a`
- [ ] For `Enter test case name (enter to stop):` enter `prompt1`
- [ ] Select a judge provider you want to use, which ever you have access to. <br>For example `open-ai`<br>
      Don't worry if you get an error saying that the necessary credentials are not set; you can set them later.
      Just enter 'y' to continue.

!!! warning "notice"
    Make sure you have the credentials set for the judge model you selected before you run the evaluation, if not you will be shown the expected environment variables to set for the judge model.


- [ ] Select the recommended model id to use
- [ ] Select `Pick your own metrics` and select: <br>`"correctness", "relevance", "completeness", "readability"` (if you make a mistake, you can always edit the `config.json` file before you run)
      <br>Press `Enter` to continue.
- [ ] Skip `Do you want to configure concurrency` by hitting `enter`

This will result in a folder structure like this:

```{ .txt .no-copy }
story-q-and-a
├── config.json
├── ground_truth.jsonl
├── ...
└── testcases
    └── prompt1
        └── task_handler.py
```

- [ ] ⚠️ If you haven't done so already, now is the time to set the credentials for the judge model you selected.

------------

### ✅ Create `story.txt`
We want to provide the story to our LLM as a judge

- [ ] Create a file named `story.txt` in the `story-q-and-a/testcases` folder
- [ ] Paste the following story into the file and save it.

The story:
```txt
The Clockmaker's Secret

In the quaint village of Greystone, an eccentric clockmaker named Elias Thorne was rumored to have crafted a clock that could alter time itself.
One day, a young woman named Clara entered his shop, searching for a gift for her father.
Among the countless clocks, she was drawn to a small, unassuming one with a single golden hand. When she asked about it, 
Elias hesitated and warned her, “It doesn’t just tell time—it listens to it. Be careful with what you wish for.”
Intrigued, Clara bought the clock, dismissing his words as a playful superstition.
That night, Clara placed the clock on her bedside table and whispered, “I wish I had more time with my father.”
The clock stopped ticking, its golden hand spinning backward before the world around her blurred.
She found herself in her childhood home, her father’s laughter filling the air.
At first, she was overjoyed to relive these moments, but soon she realized she was trapped in the past, the clock inexplicably following her wherever she went.
Panicked, Clara returned to Elias, demanding to know how to undo her wish.
The clockmaker’s face softened with sympathy as he said, “Time only grants what is asked, not what is truly needed.
To move forward, you must let go of what holds you back.”
With that cryptic advice, Clara clutched the clock tightly,
unsure if she could bear to leave the past behind—but knowing it was the only way to reclaim her future.
```
------------

### ✅ Prepare the Ground Truth

- [ ] Set the content of the `story-q-and-a/ground_truth.jsonl` file to:

```json
{ "name": "test1", "description": "Why did Clara feel trapped after using the clock", "expected_result": "Clara initially enjoyed reliving moments with her father but soon realized she was stuck in the past and unable to return to the present. The clock’s mysterious power had granted her wish literally, but it came at the cost of her ability to move forward in life.", "payload": { "question": "Why did Clara feel trapped after using the clock?" } }
{ "name": "test2", "description": "What advice did Elias give Clara to fix her situation?", "expected_result": "Elias told Clara, “Time only grants what is asked, not what is truly needed. To move forward, you must let go of what holds you back.” This implied that Clara had to release her emotional attachment to the past to break free from its hold and return to the present.", "payload": { "question": "What advice did Elias give Clara to fix her situation?" } }
{ "name": "test3", "description": "What might the clock symbolize in the story?", "expected_result": "The clock symbolizes the passage of time and the danger of dwelling too much on the past. It serves as a reminder that while we may wish to revisit cherished memories, clinging to them can prevent us from living in the present and embracing the future.", "payload": { "question": "What might the clock symbolize in the story?" } }
```

These are three questions and their expected answers that the judge LLM would check against.

### ✅ Implement `prompt1` handler

!!! info
    Below you can find code samples for implementing your plugin with the popular LLM providers.
    Most examples use LiteLLM (which is installed with `simpleval`), but there are also examples for Bedrock, and OpenAI SDK.

- [ ] Copy the code below to `story-q-and-a/testcases/prompt1/task_handler.py` according to the LLM provider you are using.

This code is calling an LLM, asking it to answer the provided question about the story.
The simple prompt is set at `prompt`, instructing the LLM to answer the question about the story.

### ✅ Implement `prompt2` handler
Now we will implement `prompt2`: a pirate who answers the question about the story.

- [ ] Copy the `prompt1` directory to `prompt2`.

- [ ] Update `prompt` in `story-q-and-a/testcases/prompt2/task_handler.py` to:

```python
prompt = f'Read this short story and answer the question at the end You must use pirate language in your responses. Story: {story_content}. Question: {payload["question"]}'
```

### Final Directory Structure
Your directory structure should look like this:

```{ .txt .no-copy }
story-q-and-a
├── config.json
├── ground_truth.jsonl
├── ...
└── testcases
    ├── story.txt
    ├── prompt1
    │   └── task_handler.py
    └── prompt2
         └── task_handler.py
```

## Running the Evaluation 🏃‍♂️

### ✅ Running the eval process

- [ ] Verify that you have the credentials set for running the LLM and LLM-as-a-judge (API key, for example)
- [ ] Run for the two testcases:

```bash
simpleval run -e story-q-and-a -t prompt1
```

```bash
simpleval run -e story-q-and-a -t prompt2
```

In case of errors, look in the error logs for the test case you ran, for example:

`story-q-and-a/testcases/prompt1/llm_task_errors.txt` 

and 

`story-q-and-a/testcases/prompt1/eval_errors.txt`.

Fix the issues and run again. simpleval will only run the failing tests.

!!! tip
    If for any reason you need to run everything, **overwriting all previous results**, use the -o flag:
    ```bash
    simpleval run -e story-q-and-a -t prompt1 -o
    ```
    ⚠️ Just keep in mind that this will overwrite all previous results.

### ✅ Review the results
- [ ] Go over the result reports for each prompt.
- [ ] You can also run a head-to-head comparison by running:

```bash
simpleval reports compare -e story-q-and-a -t1 prompt1 -t2 prompt2
```

- [ ] You can also create a summary report to see all testcases (you can optionally specify a primary metric to focus on, such as `readability`):

```bash
simpleval reports summarize -e story-q-and-a [--primary-metric readability]
```

Your LLM as a judge should detect the pirate language in the second prompt and score it accordingly, usually under the `readability` metric, as you can see here:

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="../media/tutorial-readability.png" alt="Report" width="75%">
    <div style="font-size: 0.95em; color: #555; margin-top: 8px;">
        Figure: Comparison Report highlighting the readability metric
    </div>

## Troubleshooting 🕵️‍♂️

* **Evaluation finished with errors:** Check the `llm_task_errors.txt` and `eval_errors.txt` files in the test case folders (`story-q-and-a/testcases/prompt1/` and `story-q-and-a/testcases/prompt2/`).
* **Transient errors:** In case of transient errors like rate limits or rare parsing errors, you can simply run the evaluation again; only the failed test cases will run.
* **Verbose logging:** You can always run with `-v` to get more verbose output.
