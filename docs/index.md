### What's In The Box? 🎁
The built-in evaluation uses the "LLM as a Judge" technique, implemented with various LLM providers—learn more about it [here](https://github.com/llm-as-a-judge/Awesome-LLM-as-a-judge){:target="_blank"}.


### Why Simple-Eval?
It is dead simple and easily customizable.

Often using an evaluation platform is an overkill, and other frameworks did not match the simple requirements we had.
And so, simpleval was born.
