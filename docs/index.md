### What's In The Box? üéÅ
The built-in evaluation is using the "LLM As a Judge" technique, based on the [AWS Bedrock LLM As a Judge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-evaluation-type-judge-prompt.html) implemented with various LLM providers.

### Why Simple-Eval?
It is dead simple and easily customizable.

Often using an evaluation platform is an overkill, and other frameworks did not match the simple requirements we had.
And so, simpleval was born.
