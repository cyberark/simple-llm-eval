{"metric": "no_ground_truth_simple", "result": "partially correct", "explanation": "The user inquiry is 'I need a receipt for my purchase. Where can I get it?'. This is a question related to obtaining a receipt, which is typically associated with purchase or transaction details. Among the given categories, 'Refund/Returns' is the closest category related to purchase documentation and post-purchase issues. 'General Question' is a broad category but the inquiry is specifically about a purchase-related document, so 'Refund/Returns' fits better than 'General Question'. Therefore, classifying it as 'General Question' is not fully accurate; it should be 'Refund/Returns'. Hence, the candidate response is partially correct but not fully accurate.", "normalized_score": 0.5, "llm_run_result": {"name": "classify-product-text10", "prompt": "You are a text classification model.
