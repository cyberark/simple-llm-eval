Logical Cohesion:\n   - Since the response is just \"Spam\" without any additional explanation or reasoning, there are no opportunities for logical errors or contradictions.\n   - The brevity of the response aligns with the instruction to \"Only return one of the two categories 'Spam' or 'Not Spam' without any additional text or explanation.\"\n\n3.
