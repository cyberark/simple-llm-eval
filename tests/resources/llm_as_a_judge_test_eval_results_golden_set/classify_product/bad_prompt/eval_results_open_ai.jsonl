The task requires classifying the inquiry into one of four categories: 'Feature Inquiry', 'Refund/Returns', 'Positive Testimonial', or 'General Question'. The candidate response classifies this inquiry as 'Positive Testimonial'. However, a 'Positive Testimonial' would be a statement praising or endorsing a product or service, which is not the case here. The inquiry is a request for information about obtaining a receipt, which is more aligned with a 'General Question' or possibly 'Refund/Returns' if it were about returning or refunding.
